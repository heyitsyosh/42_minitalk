It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus.</p>*

## Score: 125/100ðŸŽ‰

## Description:
Client converts message into binary data, then sends data to server process using the siganls SIGUSER1, SIGUSER2.  
Server signal handler reconstructs data and prints message.  
(In bonus implementation, server sends ack signal after recieving full message.)

## Set-up:
First, enter directory with `cd minitalk`.  
Then use any makefile command.

#### Makefile Commands:
```C
make        //compile executables (./server, ./client)
make bonus  //compile executables (./server, ./client) for bonus implmentation 
make server //compile ./server
make client //compile ./client
make clean  //delete .o
make fclean //delete .o and executables
make re     //delete .o and executables, then recompile
```

## Usage:  
```
./server
./client <server_pid> <message_to_send>
```
